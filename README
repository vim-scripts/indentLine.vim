This indent guides plugin is used for displaying thin vertical lines at each indentation level for code indented with spaces. For code indented with tabs, I think there is no need to support it, using :set list lcs=tab:\|\ (here is a space) can achieve it.

-Indent Guides(vimscript #3361) uses color to display indent levels. 

Requirements:
This plugin takes advantage of newly provided conceal feature in Vim 7.3, so Vim 7.3 with conceal feature is needed.

Setting custom line colors:
For gvim, hi Conceal guifg=(color you like) guibg=NONE
For vim, hi Conceal ctermfg=(color you like) ctermbg=NONE
